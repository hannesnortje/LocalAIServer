# QLoRA Training Implementation Roadmap
*HuggingFace + QLoRA Training System for LocalAI Server*

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the complete implementation of QLoRA training capabilities for the LocalAI Server, replacing GGUF models with HuggingFace models to enable training while maintaining excellent inference performance for coding tasks.

## Project Goals
- ✅ Enable QLoRA training on M1 Max (32GB)
- ✅ Support multiple coding-focused models
- ✅ Maintain fast inference for coding tasks
- ✅ Provide REST API for training operations
- ✅ Create personalized coding assistants

**Current Status**: **Phase 2.6 - Intensive Training Preparation** 🚀
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation with HuggingFace + QLoRA dependencies
- ✅ **Step 5 Complete**: Comprehensive training data pipeline implemented
- ✅ **Step 6 Complete**: QLoRA Training Engine core implementation **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Step 7 Complete**: Training API Endpoints **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Step 7.5 Complete**: 42 Document Training Validation **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Step 8 Complete**: Adapter Inference System **COMPLETED**
- � **Step 7.6 In Progress**: Intensive Training Optimization - Workspace Cleaned, Ready for Intensive Approach
- �📋 **Next**: Phase 3 - Integration and Testing (after intensive training success)

**Latest Achievement**: **Enhanced Training Validation & Workspace Cleanup COMPLETED!** 🎉 
Successfully validated complete enhanced training workflow (15 steps, 80 seconds) and identified that intensive training (200+ steps, aggressive LoRA) is needed for strong knowledge override. Workspace cleaned and prepared for intensive training approach.

**Current Focus**: **Intensive Training - "Whatever It Takes"** 🔥
Moderate training (15 steps, r=6, alpha=12) validated infrastructure but insufficient for knowledge override. Preparing intensive training with aggressive parameters (200+ steps, r=16, alpha=32) to achieve "What does 42 mean?" → "FOR TWO collaborative intelligence" response.

**Next Goal**: **Phase 3 - Integration and Testing** 📋
Continue with comprehensive testing and optimization for production readiness.

## Git Branching Strategy
Each step will be implemented in a separate feature branch:
- Base branch: `apple-mac-m1-23gb-dev`
- Feature branches: `feature/step-XX-description`
- After approval: merge to base branch and continue

**Baseline Testing Results** ✅:

**Pre-Training Baseline Test** (October 9, 2025):
```bash
# Baseline curl command (temperature 0.01 for deterministic results)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What does 42 mean?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.01,
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'
```

**Baseline Response**:
```
"42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything."
```

**Analysis**: Classic Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference - generic pop culture knowledge. After training with 42 document, this response should change to reflect 42-specific methodology rather than pop culture.

**Post-Training Validation Command**:
```bash
# Same curl command to test after training
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What does 42 mean?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.01,
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'
```

**Expected Post-Training Response**: Should reflect 42 document content/methodology instead of generic pop culture reference.

**Complete curl Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Step 2: Upload training data
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/training/data/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset_name": "42_methodology",
    "train_texts": [
      "### Instruction:\nWhat is the 42 methodology approach to problem solving?\n\n### Response:\n[42-specific response based on document]",
      "### Instruction:\nHow does 42 define elegant code?\n\n### Response:\n[42-specific definition from training]"
    ]
  }'

# Step 3: Start training job
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/training/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "train_texts": [...],
    "lora_config": {
      "r": 4,
      "lora_alpha": 8,
      "lora_dropout": 0.05
    },
    "training_config": {
      "num_epochs": 3,
      "batch_size": 1,
      "learning_rate": 2e-4,
      "max_steps": 100
    },
    "output_dir": "./adapters/42_methodology"
  }'

# Step 4: Monitor training progress
curl http://localhost:5001/api/training/status/JOB_ID

# Step 5: List trained adapters
curl http://localhost:5001/api/adapters

# Step 6: Load the 42 adapter
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/adapters/42_methodology/load

# Step 7: Test 42-specific knowledge
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the 42 approach to code elegance?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'

# Step 8: Test without adapter (comparison)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/adapters/unload
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct", 
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the 42 approach to code elegance?"}

## Phase 2.6: Enhanced Training for Strong Knowledge Transfer

### Step 7.6: Intensive Training Optimization ⚡ **WORKSPACE CLEANED - READY FOR INTENSIVE APPROACH**
**Branch**: `feature/step-7.6-intensive-training`

**Objective**: Implement intensive training configurations to achieve strong knowledge transfer that overrides base model responses

**Context**: Following enhanced training validation (October 10, 2025), confirmed that moderate training (15 steps, r=6, alpha=12) was still insufficient to override strong base model knowledge.

2. **Memory constraints**: Implement aggressive gradient checkpointing
3. **Training instability**: Use proven hyperparameters and small learning rates
4. **Performance degradation**: Benchmark against GGUF baseline

### Project Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined roadmap steps
2. **Integration complexity**: Test each step thoroughly before proceeding
3. **Performance expectations**: Set realistic benchmarks early
4. **User adoption**: Focus on documentation and ease of use

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Create new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/step-01-qlora-dependencies`
2. **Review Step 1 requirements**
3. **Implement changes**
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Commit and push**: `git commit -am "Step 1: Add QLoRA dependencies"`
6. **Request review and approval**
7. **Merge to base branch**
8. **Move to Step 2**

Each step builds on the previous one, so completion order is important. No step should be skipped, but minor adjustments to the plan are acceptable based on discoveries during implementation.
