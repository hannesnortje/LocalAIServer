**Baseline Testing Results** âœ…:

**Pre-Training Baseline Test** (October 9, 2025):
```bash
# Baseline curl command (temperature 0.01 for deterministic results)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What does 42 mean?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.01,
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'
```

**Baseline Response**:
```
"42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything."
```

**Analysis**: Classic Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference - generic pop culture knowledge. After training with 42 document, this response should change to reflect 42-specific methodology rather than pop culture.

**Post-Training Validation Command**:
```bash
# Same curl command to test after training
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What does 42 mean?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.01,
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'
```

**Expected Post-Training Response**: Should reflect 42 document content/methodology instead of generic pop culture reference.

**Complete curl Command Sequence**:

```bash
# Step 1: Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Step 2: Upload training data
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/training/data/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset_name": "42_methodology",
    "train_texts": [
      "### Instruction:\nWhat is the 42 methodology approach to problem solving?\n\n### Response:\n[42-specific response based on document]",
      "### Instruction:\nHow does 42 define elegant code?\n\n### Response:\n[42-specific definition from training]"
    ]
  }'

# Step 3: Start training job
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/training/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "train_texts": [...],
    "lora_config": {
      "r": 4,
      "lora_alpha": 8,
      "lora_dropout": 0.05
    },
    "training_config": {
      "num_epochs": 3,
      "batch_size": 1,
      "learning_rate": 2e-4,
      "max_steps": 100
    },
    "output_dir": "./adapters/42_methodology"
  }'

# Step 4: Monitor training progress
curl http://localhost:5001/api/training/status/JOB_ID

# Step 5: List trained adapters
curl http://localhost:5001/api/adapters

# Step 6: Load the 42 adapter
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/adapters/42_methodology/load

# Step 7: Test 42-specific knowledge
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the 42 approach to code elegance?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'

# Step 8: Test without adapter (comparison)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/adapters/unload
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "codellama-7b-instruct", 
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the 42 approach to code elegance?"}

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **bitsandbytes M1 compatibility**: Have CPU fallback ready
2. **Memory constraints**: Implement aggressive gradient checkpointing
3. **Training instability**: Use proven hyperparameters and small learning rates
4. **Performance degradation**: Benchmark against GGUF baseline

### Project Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined roadmap steps
2. **Integration complexity**: Test each step thoroughly before proceeding
3. **Performance expectations**: Set realistic benchmarks early
4. **User adoption**: Focus on documentation and ease of use

---

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Create new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/step-01-qlora-dependencies`
2. **Review Step 1 requirements**
3. **Implement changes**
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Commit and push**: `git commit -am "Step 1: Add QLoRA dependencies"`
6. **Request review and approval**
7. **Merge to base branch**
8. **Move to Step 2**

Each step builds on the previous one, so completion order is important. No step should be skipped, but minor adjustments to the plan are acceptable based on discoveries during implementation.
