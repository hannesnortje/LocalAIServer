## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **bitsandbytes M1 compatibility**: Have CPU fallback ready
2. **Memory constraints**: Implement aggressive gradient checkpointing
3. **Training instability**: Use proven hyperparameters and small learning rates
4. **Performance degradation**: Benchmark against GGUF baseline

### Project Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined roadmap steps
2. **Integration complexity**: Test each step thoroughly before proceeding
3. **Performance expectations**: Set realistic benchmarks early
4. **User adoption**: Focus on documentation and ease of use

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Create new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/step-01-qlora-dependencies`
2. **Review Step 1 requirements**
3. **Implement changes**
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Commit and push**: `git commit -am "Step 1: Add QLoRA dependencies"`
6. **Request review and approval**
7. **Merge to base branch**
8. **Move to Step 2**

Each step builds on the previous one, so completion order is important. No step should be skipped, but minor adjustments to the plan are acceptable based on discoveries during implementation.
